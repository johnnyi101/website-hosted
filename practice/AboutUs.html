            We are also committed to charging you unreasonable prices for your tickets ensuring that you pay huge amounts<br>

        <p class ="whatwedo">We are a company dedicated to running trains in the most incompetent way possible. Some of our trains </br>
            arrive, some do not and some break down along the way. But you can rest assured that we are doing</br>
            everything in our power to avoid doing our job properly.</p>

            We are proud to serve the south of England`s most hacked off belligerent commuters. It is our keen </br>
            interest to ensure that they are uncomfortable and late for everything. Sad, tired and irritable commuters</br>
            we salute you, your bank accounts and your poor mental well-being.</p>
